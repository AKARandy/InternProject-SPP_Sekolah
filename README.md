To use this code:
1. Clone the project
2. Run "train_cv", since the code is copied from Kaggle notebook, please adjust the file paths. You can adjust the amount of fold as you wish or change the model
3. After running the code, you can pick a model to try and get the full details with the "graphics_of_model" code by putting your model and model features on the paths

The data is scraped from multiple sources with selenium and manually (for SPP and some of the Kurikulum) and has some feature engineering done already on the file, but there's also some feature engineering done on the code

The guide on data collecting part will be released in the future, for now i will provide the full data of Surabaya and Sidoarjo

Sources for the data:
https://dapo.dikdasmen.go.id/
https://data.kemendikdasmen.go.id/
https://sekolah.data.kemendikdasmen.go.id/
https://vervalyayasan.data.kemdikbud.go.id/



Data quality is ok for open source Indonesian data on the internet, although there are rough edges everywhere

Feel free to use and/or modify my data and code, just credit me if you want to publish this for work or something
